# Instagram clone with react, node and restify

This is a very simple clone of instagram. I learned how to handle authenticated user on the frontend, How to protected route on the client. On the backend, I used jwt for authenticate user and protect routes. In this project, I used mongodb for database. Node, for backend service. I used a framework called `restify` for this whole project. This is fully responsive and user-friendly.
